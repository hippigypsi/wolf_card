			<p class="p1"><i>Wolfpacks are established according to a strict hierarchy, with a dominant male at the top and his mate not far behind. Usually this male and female are the only animals of the pack to breed.</i></p>
			<ul class="list">
				<li><span><b>Binomial Name</b></span>: Canis lupus</li>
				<li><span><b>Average Length</b></span>: 41–63 inches</li>
				<li><span><b>Average Lifespan</b></span>: 6 to 8 years</li>
				<li><span><b>Habitat</b></span>:  Deserts, Grasslands, Forests and Arctic Tundras</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="p2">The gray wolf is a social animal, whose basic social unit consists of a mated pair, accompanied by the pair's adult offspring. The average pack consists of a family of 5–11 animals (1–2 adults, 3–6 juveniles and 1–3 yearlings), or sometimes two or three such families, with exceptionally large packs consisting of 42 wolves being known. In ideal conditions, the mated pair produces pups every year, with such offspring typically staying in the pack for 10–54 months before dispersing. Triggers for dispersal include the onset of sexual maturity and competition within the pack for food. The distance travelled by dispersing wolves varies widely; some stay in the vicinity of the parental group, while other individuals may travel great distances of 390 km, 206 km, and 670 km from their natal packs. A new pack is usually founded by an unrelated dispersing male and female, travelling together in search of an area devoid of other hostile packs. Wolf packs rarely adopt other wolves into their fold, and typically kill them.</p>
